## Pulverization 1: Definition and purpose | THINKY USA
Definition of pulverization "Pulverization" (comminution, crushing, grinding) is the process of applying an external force to a (solid) material of a certain size to destroy it and reduce it into pieces that are smaller than the original size. Pulverization has long been done

## Pulverizer
A pulverizer or grinder is a mechanical device for the grinding of many different types of materials. For example, a pulverizer puritch is used to pulverize coal for combustion in the steam-generating furnaces of coal power plants.
