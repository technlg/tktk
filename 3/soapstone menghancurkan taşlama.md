## Soapstone for Kitchen Countertops - The Spruce
Soapstone is the common name for the naturally occurring stone known as steatite, a magnesium-rich metamorphic rock containing a high percentage of talc—the same substance found in baby powder. The softer varieties, often called artistic soapstone, actually have a silky, soapy feel to them, and may contain as much as 80 percent talc.
